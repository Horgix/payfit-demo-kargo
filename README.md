# PayFit - Kargo Demo

This repository contains demo material for Kargo.

If you're from PayFit and wondering why this is a personal repository instead
of a "corporate one", here's a quote from our repository creation flow on
GitHub:

> You may not create public or private repositories by organization policy.

And I don't want to go through all the hoops of authenticating Kargo to an
**internal** GitHub repository as well as to a private ECR repository only for
a hello-world demo. "Bias for Action", efficiency, etc.!
